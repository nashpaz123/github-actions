Use tmate to ssh into the runner instance:

    ```yaml
    name: Use Secrets and Env Variables

    on: [push]

    jobs:
      use_secrets_job:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        environment: env1

        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
          uses: actions/checkout@v4

        - name: Print secret
          run: echo ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }} > 1.txt

        - name: Run tmate
          uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v2
      ```
